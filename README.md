# MSCI240 Assignment 2

Assignment 2 for MSCI 240 Data Structures and Algorithms.

This assignment involves implementing a DodgeballManager class that uses a provided list class.


## Launch Configurations

There are two launch configurations (visible in `.vscode/launch.json`):

 - `A2: DodgeballMain interactive` runs an interactive session with expected input from the terminal.
 - `A2: DodgeballMain file input` runs an interactive session with expected input `input.txt`.


## Unit tests

There are several unit tests for this assignment that test a *subset* of your required methods. You will need to complement this testing with interactive testing.

You can find these in the VS code testing module, and configure them in `settings.json` if you run into trouble.


## Running experiments

Part of this assignment involves running experiments with your implemented methods (and possibly already-implemented methods). You can edit and run `run_experiments.py`, and comment/uncomment out various parts of the code as needed to run it.
